# The required configuration parameters for connecting to an API can vary depending on the specific API and its implementation. However, there are several common parameters that are typically needed. Here are some of the key configuration parameters:

# 1. API Endpoint: This is the URL or network address where the API is hosted. It specifies the location where your requests will be sent.

# 2. Request Method: APIs support different HTTP methods for interacting with their resources, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The appropriate method needs to be specified based on the desired action.

# 3. Headers: Headers contain additional information about the request or the client making the request. Common headers include "Content-Type" (specifying the format of the request body, such as JSON or XML), "Authorization" (for authentication), and "Accept" (specifying the expected response format).

#4. Authentication: Depending on the API, you may need to provide authentication credentials to access protected resources. This can include tokens, API keys, usernames, passwords, or OAuth tokens. The authentication method required will depend on the API's security mechanisms.

#5. Query Parameters: APIs often allow you to pass additional parameters in the URL to customize the request or filter the response. These parameters can be used for pagination, sorting, filtering, or searching data.

#6. Request Body: For some API requests, you may need to send additional data in the request body. This is common for POST, PUT, and PATCH requests where you are creating or updating a resource. The format of the request body will depend on the API's specifications.

#7. SSL/TLS: If the API requires secure communication, you may need to configure SSL/TLS settings, including the certificate validation process.

#These are some of the general configuration parameters you may encounter when connecting to an API. However, it's important to refer to the API's documentation or developer resources for specific details on the required configuration parameters, as each API may have its own unique requirements and additional parameters.

# In this example, we're making a GET request to the https://api.example.com/users endpoint with query parameters for pagination (page and limit). We're also setting the Content-Type header to application/json and including an Authorization header with the API key.

import requests

# API endpoint
url = 'https://api.example.com/users'

# Request headers
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
}

# Query parameters
params = {
    'page': 1,
    'limit': 10
}

try:
    # Send GET request to the API
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)

    # Check response status code
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Successful request
        data = response.json()
        print(data)
    else:
        # Error handling
        print(f"Request failed with status code {response.status_code}")
        print(response.text)

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
